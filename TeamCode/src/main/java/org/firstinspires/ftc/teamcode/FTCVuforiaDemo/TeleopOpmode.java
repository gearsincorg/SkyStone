/**
 * This example is designed to show how to identify a target, get the robot's position, and then plan
 * and execute an approach path to the target.
 *
 * This OpMode uses two "utility" classes to abstract (hide) the hardware and navigation GUTs.
 * These are:  Robot_Navigation.
 *
 * This LinearOpMode uses basic hardware and nav calls to drive the robot in either manual or auto mode.
 * AutoMode is engaged by pressing and holding the Left Bumper.  Release the Bumper to return to Manual Mode.
 *
 *  *ManualMode* simply uses the joysticks to move the robot in three degrees of freedom.
 *  - Left stick X (translate left and right)
 *  - Left Stick Y (translate forward and backwards)
 *  - Right Stick X (rotate CW and CCW)
 *
 *  *AutoMode* will approach the image target and attempt to reach a position directly in front
 *  of the center line of the image, with a predefined stand-off distance.
 *
 *  To simplify this example, a gyro is NOT used.  Therefore there is no attempt being made to stabilize
 *  strafing motions, or to perform field-centric driving.
